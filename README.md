#### Agile Threat Modeling Toolkit

Threagile (see [https://threagile.io](https://threagile.io) for more details) is an open-source toolkit for 
agile threat modeling: 

It allows to model an architecture with its assets in an agile fashion as a YAML file directly inside the IDE. 
Upon execution of the Threagile toolkit all standard risk rules (as well as individual custom rules if present) 
are checked against the architecture model.
